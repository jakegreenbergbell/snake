# Snake Game

https://jakegreenbergbell.github.io/snake/

My take on the classic snake game. Utilized jQuery, HTML Canvas, Bootstrap styling, along with vanilla JavaScript.

Built with interesting features: 

1. The snake can go through a wall and come out the other side

2. Every turn the snake makes, evil apples appear, if the snake eats these it resets size. Meaning now it must escape itself and the evil apples.
